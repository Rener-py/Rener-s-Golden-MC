The 'Content Explorer' plays as a personal guide to show you the best and most enjoyable content the modpack has to offer.

**Free Exploration:** No linear quest lines to follow; enjoy real sandbox exploration. You are free to go at your own pace, create your own objectives, and create your own experience.

**Dynamic:** The 'Content Explorer' changes with you as you proceed through the game, it is constantly updated based on the things you have shared in the public realms, but also it learns as you unlock new areas, areas, and adventure through the game. Don't forget, it is by its nature, dynamic.
